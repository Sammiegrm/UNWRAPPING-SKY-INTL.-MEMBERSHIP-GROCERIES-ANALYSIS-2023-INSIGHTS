With the 2023 data from Sky International, we dove deep into membership patterns, gender-based behaviors, promotion influence, and app usage — all with the aim of optimizing member engagement and value delivery.

Here’s what the numbers told us — and what organizations can do next.

Tools Used
Visualization Platform: Microsoft Excel
Data Sources: Membership purchase logs, app interaction data, promotion participation, basket size history
Focus Areas: Member segmentation, behavioral trends, gender analysis, and revenue correlation
Key Data Insights
🎯 Engagement vs Promotion Participation
Engagement peaks at participation level 2, then drops sharply beyond level 5.
Implication: Too many promotions may overwhelm rather than engage members.
📱 App Usage & Gender Behavior
Female members showed higher in-app engagement when buying store brands (71 vs. 52).
Males had a balanced usage pattern (53 yes, 51 no), indicating a more consistent shopping behavior.
🔁 Membership Auto-Renew
227 members had auto-renew enabled, vs. 73 who didn’t.
Auto-renew clearly correlates with deeper commitment or satisfaction levels.
💳 Membership Tier Comparison
Premium members spent significantly more ($45,008) than Standard members ($34,592).
Suggests that premium incentives are working — possibly offering better ROI to the business.
🚻 Gender-Based Spending
Male shoppers outspent females ($8,929 vs. $7,207), though both showed strong engagement.
A great cue for personalized marketing by gender.
🛍️ Store Brand Buying Behavior
Surprisingly, customers who did not buy store brands had a higher basket size ($66,314 vs. $65,042).
Indicates brand preference is still strong — even among loyalty members.
📅 Time-Based Trends
Membership or engagement grew significantly from 2019 to 2023, peaking in 2023 (30.67%).
Slight decline to 23.33% in 2024 suggests potential fatigue or market saturation.
Recommendations
Optimize Promotion Frequency
Target the sweet spot of engagement (around 1–3 promotions). Too many offers can backfire.
Enhance Store Brand Incentives
Provide better benefits for store-brand shoppers to boost basket sizes and brand loyalty.
Personalize by Gender & Tier
Male and premium-tier members show the highest ROI. Tailor offers and content accordingly.
Leverage Auto-Renewers
Create referral programs and loyalty bonuses for this high-commitment group to amplify retention.
Reignite 2024 Growth
Given the dip after 2023, consider seasonal campaigns, exclusive member events, and feedback loops to sustain momentum.
Conclusion
2023 gave us rich, actionable data — and 2024 is the year to capitalize on it. From smarter promotions to deeper segmentation, Sky Intl. has a real opportunity to lead the grocery membership space with strategic innovation and member-first thinking.
